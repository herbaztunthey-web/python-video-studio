# 🌦️ Weather Impact Analysis: Economic Data Project

## Project Overview
This project explores weather patterns using a real-time API. As an aspiring **Economic and Data Analyst**, I am building this to understand how environmental variables (like temperature and humidity) can serve as indicators for economic trends such as energy demand or agricultural shifts.

## Technologies Used
* **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis
* **Weather API** for real-time data acquisition

## Key Analysis Goals
1. **Trend Identification:** Analyzing weekly temperature fluctuations.
2. **Correlation Studies:** Examining the relationship between pressure and humidity.
3. **Portfolio Building:** Deploying data insights to GitHub and Render.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open `weather_analysis.ipynb` in VS Code.
3. Add your API Key to the first cell and run!
